# tempconverter
This is a simple Fahrenheit to Celcius, and vice versa, temperature converter I made to experiment with Rust.
There are some features that I would like to add but don't want to waste time on right now:
-An option to quit or continue after completing one conversion (I tried to add this but the program would panic when trying to select which way to convert for the second time).
-An option to convert either F or C to K, and vice versa.
